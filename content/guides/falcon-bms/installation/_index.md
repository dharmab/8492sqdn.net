# Things You Need

A Windows computer. Pretty much any modern gaming PC with a fast CPU will work; BMS is not a terribly demanding game.

A HOTAS. This guide assumes you have a quality HOTAS with plenty of buttons, not just a simple flight stick.

<aside>
🎮 Gamepads don’t work well for throttle control in BMS, and the BMS developers have spoken out against supporting gamepads. A joystick or HOTAS are therefore recommended for BMS.

Some type of [head tracker](../../headtracker/) so you don’t have to use the mouse to look around. Alternatively, BMS has VR support. See my DCS VR headset guide for some good choices for flight simulation: [VR Headset](../../dcs/performance/#virtual-reality) 

# Buy Falcon 4.0

Falcon BMS is a total conversion mod of Falcon 4.0. Per the BMS team’s agreement with Micropose, Falcon BMS requires Falcon 4.0 to be installed.

## GOG.com

The best place to get Falcon 4.0 is from GOG as part of [Falcon Collection](https://www.gog.com/en/game/falcon_collection). This version is DRM-free, meaning the installer can be saved offline and can be copied to any of your computers. It is the closest thing to actually owning a digital game. As a bonus, it also includes the first three Falcon games.

After buying Falcon Collection, Falcon 4.0 will be a download in the extras for Falcon 3.0 Gold.

Run the installer and install Falcon 4.0 anywhere. Run Falcon 4.0 once to make sure it creates the Windows Registry entries needed for Falcon BMS. It’s okay if the game doesn’t work as long as the EXE is run once.

## Steam

You can buy and install [Falcon 4.0 on Steam.](https://store.steampowered.com/app/429530/Falcon_40/)

Launch the game once to make sure it creates the Windows Registry entries needed for Falcon BMS. It’s okay if the game doesn’t work as long as it is launched once.
