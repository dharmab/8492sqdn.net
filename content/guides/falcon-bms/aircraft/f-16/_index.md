Map the controls in the diagram to your stick as you see fit. Reference both `Docs\02 Aircraft Manuals & Checklists\01 F-16\TO 1F-16CMAM-1 BMS.pdf`, section 17.1 and `Docs\02 Aircraft Manuals & Checklists\01 F-16\TO 1F-16CMAM-34-1-1 BMS.pdf`, section 2.1.5 for a description of functions.

All controls on the stick are important.

## Assign Throttle

Set the category dropdown to LEFT CONSOLE. Scroll down and find the section for THROTTLE QUADRANT SYSTEM.

Diagram from the DCS manual, because BMS’ manuals don’t have a complete diagram of the throttle…

Assign the controls as you see fit. Reference both `Docs\02 Aircraft Manuals & Checklists\01 F-16\TO 1F-16CMAM-1 BMS.pdf`, section 2.45 and `Docs\02 Aircraft Manuals & Checklists\01 F-16\TO 1F-16CMAM-34-1-1 BMS.pdf`, section 2.1.5 for a description of functions.

The Hands-On Black-Out Paddle Switch (HOBO) is not implemented in BMS. All other controls on the throttle are important.

## Assign Other Controls

Assign any other controls as you see fit. Reference both `Docs\02 Aircraft Manuals & Checklists\01 F-16\TO 1F-16CMAM-1 BMS.pdf`, section 1 and `Docs\02 Aircraft Manuals & Checklists\01 F-16\TO 1F-16CMAM-34-1-1 BMS.pdf`, Part II for a description of cockpit layout and switch functions.

You’ll probably need: `GEAR: LG Handle`, `MISC: PITCH Switch`, `MISC: ROLL Switch`. Flaps in the F-16 are automatic, so no need to bind them.
