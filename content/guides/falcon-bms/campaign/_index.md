In the START CAMPAIGN window, click OK.

Wait for the campaign to progress until missions are available in the FRAG ORDER table. Pick a mission that looks interesting to you, then click one of the airplanes in the left sidebar to slot in.

> ðŸ“˜ For a list of mission types and success criteria, see the BMS User Manualâ€™s section on **KTO Campaign Objectives, Mission Types and Success Factors**.

Click BRIEFING in the bottom bar to read the mission briefing. Take special note of the Comm ladder- you wonâ€™t be able to communicate with your flight, package and controllers without tuning these frequencies.

Click LOADOUT in the bottom bar to edit your loadout and set weapon laser codes.

Click DATA CARTRIDGE in the bottom.

In the Data Cartridge pop-up window, click LOAD. This will load the missionâ€™s data into your data cartridge, such as the radio presets. Customize your data cartridge as you see fit.

> ðŸ“˜ You can learn more about the Data Cartridge in the BMS User Manualâ€™s chapter on the **Data Transfer Cartridge**.

Click TAKEOFF in the bottom bar.

Click RAMP for a cold start or TAXI/RUNWAY for a hot start. Pick hot start if itâ€™s your first time and you just need to test things out!

Wait for the timer to run down. (The game is running the campaign in the background, so this might take a while depending on your CPU.)

Once in cockpit, tune the radio to the briefed departure ground frequency (TAXI start) or tower frequency (RUNWAY start) and press `T` to communicate with ATC.

> ðŸ“˜ You can learn more about how to communicate with AI and ATC in the COMMS-NAV-BOOK manual.
