A curated list of training, singleplayer and multiplayer content for DCS providing hundreds of hours of gameplay.

# Training

## Self-Paced Flight Training

Flying a module for the first time? Start a free flight mission and just fly around for a while. Try level turns, flying at different airspeeds, and some basic maneuvers to get a feel for the jet.

Then, learn how to start up the aircraft. Make your own checklists as you learn to help internalize the steps.

Practice take-offs and landings. Do ten touch-and-go landings in a row. Do a few full stop landings. Practice until you can safely land the jet every time.

If your plane is naval, practice carrier launches and CASE I recoveries using [Bankler's CASE 1 Recovery Trainer](https://forum.dcs.world/topic/189005-banklers-case-1-recovery-trainer/).

Learn how to use your navigation system. Create a flight plan and follow it. Add a waypoint mid-flight. Create mark points. Use the TACAN receiver to find airfields and refueling tankers.

## Self-Paced Weapons Training

Learn basic employment of weapons. Practice each weapon one at a time using Sedlo’s trainer mission.

## BVR Timeline

They key to surviving medium to long range air combat is the BVR timeline. If you learn how to follow a timeline, you will be invincible. If you don’t, you’ll suffer from frustrating and avoidable deaths.

## Basic Fighter Maneuvers

BFM and dogfighting is a difficult topic to learn by yourself. The AI opponents in DCS cheat and teach you bad habits.

The best way to learn BFM is to dogfight against a human with better skills and debrief every fight. A human can teach you more in an evening than you would learn in a year.

Main article: [Basic Fighter Maneuvers](../combat-sim/bfm/)

Supplementary resources for BFM:

*Speed & Angels* campaign by Reflected

Note that DCS is a flawed simulation of real life. If you are mostly interested in milsim and roleplaying real tactices, the above resources are useful. If you are interested in optimizing your performance, you should learn the game mechanics, not just the real tactics.

{{< youtube A9lmDbSgO2A >}}

## Advanced Topics

Learn how to:

- Perform an overhead break landing. Shit Hot! Useful to quickly recover a full flight of aircraft.
- Fly in near-zero visibility conditions over a long distance using instruments. Bonus points for doing it in VR! A rite of passage.
- Fly a Time-on-Target attack where your ordnance hits the target within a 15 second window. A useful skill for coordinating with other players.
- Fly an emergency fuel profile. A useful skill if you burn too much fuel in a dogfight, or get a hole shot in your fuel tank.
- Fly in close formation with other humans. Difficult, stressful and rewarding.
- Air to Air Refuel. This is just formation flying with extra steps- you can do it!
- Land on the carrier in CASE III conditions (night / poor weather). The most stressful thing I’ve ever done in a video game.

## Open Event Groups

[Tactical DCS](https://discord.gg/tacticaldcs) - Weekly training sessions, campaigns, and events. Organized training courses from time to time.

[Border Zone](https://discord.gg/WzqXveJC) - Regular campaigns and events.

## Private Squadrons

The best gameplay in DCS is found by joining a private squadron and playing organized, structured missions together. You can meet squadrons on the [official forums](https://forum.dcs.world/forum/144-squadron-recruiting/) and on the [wingman finder](https://discord.gg/dcs-wingman-finder) Discord.

Private Squadrons are a gateway to private campaigns, such as Red Flag and Summer Skies.

When choosing a squadron, ask:

- Is the squadron a safe and welcoming environment? Do I enjoy spending time with the members?
- Are they a good match for my skill level? Am I looking for a casual or more serious environment? Are there good learning opportunities?
- Do they fly the modules and missions I’m most interested in?
- Do their events align with my time zone and life schedule?

Always fly a few trial missions with a squadron before committing to join! If a squadron doesn’t offer this, then they have low standards and you should look elsewhere.

## Private Campaigns

If you reach the upper tiers of proficiency, you may have the opportunity to participate in private campaigns such as Red Flag or Summer Skies. These represent the peak of combat flight simulation.
