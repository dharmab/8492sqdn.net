# Singleplayer Tier List

Tier|Terrains
-|-
S|Syria, Persian Gulf, Normandy (WW2)
A|Nevada
B|Kola, Channel (WW2)
C|Afghanistan, Iraq, Sinai, South Atlantic
F|

Syria has excellent content for practically every post-WW2 DCS world and is a must-buy.

Persian Gulf has excellent campaigns for naval aircraft. Shore-based aircraft can skip it.

Normandy is the standard WW2 terrain.

Nevada has excellent content for the A-10C, F-4E, and F-14 - arguably, three of the best campaigns in the game! Otherwise, it can be skipped unless you like the setting.

Kola and Channel have some good campaigns, if you've already played the ones on the other maps.

Maps listed in C tier have no paid campaign content, so you'll have to make your own missions.

# Multiplayer Tier List

Tier|Terrains
-|-
S|Syria, Normandy (WW2)
A|Persian Gulf
B|
C|Afghanistan, Iraq, Sinai, Nevada, Kola, 
F|South Atlantic, Channel (WW2)

Syria is the de facto standard multiplayer map and is a must-buy.

Normandy is the standard WW2 terrain.

Persian Gulf has some interesting servers.

Afghanistan, Iraq, Sinai, Nevada and Kola are not common on public servers and are mostly used by private squadrons. Only buy the ones you need, if any.

South Atlantic is virtually unused in multiplayer.

The Channel is no longer used in multiplater because Normandy contains the entire area of The Channel.
