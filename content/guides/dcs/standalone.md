**Most players should use the standalone version of DCS World rather than the Steam version.**

## Advantages of the Standalone Version

### Choice of Store

The Steam version of DCS World only allows the use of content purchased on Steam. The Standalone version allows the use of content purchased from Steam, the ED store, the Heatblur store, and the OrbX store. 

Competition between stores can help you get a better deal on your purchases.

- Steam has favorable exchange rates and foreign transaction fees for some countries.
- The ED store offers ED Miles, a loyalty program that can be redeemed for discounts on some future purchases from the ED Store, such as modules from Eagle Dynamics.
- The Heatblur store offers exclusive merchandise for Heatblur products. For example, preorders for the F-4 Phantom included an option to add a T-shirt at an inexpensive price.
- The OrbX store offers Orbs, a loyalty program that can be redeemed for discounts on future OrbX purchases, such as addons for Microsoft Flight Simulator.

The ED store starts sales earlier and ends sales later than the Steam store.

### Free Trials

The standalone version of DCS World offers free trials for most modules, allowing you to try before you buy. Each module can be trialed for 2 weeks, with the trial resetting after 6 months. Each module's trial is independent, so you can trial multiple modules at once, or trial different modules at different times.

To activate a trial, either log into the DCS World website, then go to https://www.digitalcombatsimulator.com/en/personal/licensing/trial/ and click "TRY" on the module you want to trial, or activate the trials from the game launcher.

### Longer Sales

The ED store begins sales earlier and ends sales later than the Steam store.

## Advantages of the Steam Version

### Faster Downloads

Steam's download servers are faster than ED's download servers.

### Automatic Updates

Steam will automatically keep DCS World up to date, including running updates during off-peak hours. The standalone version requires you to update on launch.
