# Sticks & Gamepads

## Recommended

### Xbox or PlayStation gamepad

You may already have one! If not, a third-party 8BitDo gamepad costs around $20.

([Not suitable for Falcon BMS](https://forum.falcon-bms.com/topic/23233/throttle-up-down-key-bindings-are-too-coarse?_=1683335735387&lang=en-US))

### Winwing Ursa Minor Fighter Joystick

A budget clone of the VKB Gladiator with more buttons and a vibration motor. Made from a cheaper-feeling plastic compared to the Gladiator. Has a fairly short throw.

![](images/ursa-minor-fighter-joystick.bmp)

### VKB Gladiator NXT EVO Space Combat Edition Premium 

Best value!

![](images/gladiator-nxt-evo-sce-premium.webp)

### Winwing Orion 2 ViperAce EX (formerly F-16EX)

![](images/orion-2-f-16ex.webp)

### Virpil Constellation Alpha grip with WarBRD-D base

![](images/constellation-alpha.webp)

### VKB Gunfighter Modern Combat Edition Ultimate

![](images/gunfighter-mcg.webp)

## Recommended with Reservations

### Logitech Extreme 3D Pro

This used to be recommended as a first joystick to try flight simulators before buying an expensive HOTAS. However, the price of this joystick has increased while the price of a general-purpose gamepad has decreased, so it's not longer the best option in the price range.

![](images/extreme-3d-pro.webp)

### Thrustmaster T16000M FCS

Widely available. Commonly develops problems with axis sensors. Button layout is difficult to use while keeping hands on the HOTAS. Overall similar to the Logitech 3D Extreme Pro, but costs more.

![](images/t16000m-fcs.webp)

### VKB Gladiator NXT EVO Space Combat Edition Standard

The Premium is worth the extra $30 for the extra hat, trigger and analog stick. However, the Standard may fit within import *de minimis* limits in some European countries.

![](images/gladiator-nxt-evo-sce-standard.webp)

### VKB Gladiator NXT EVO WWII Combat Edition

Good choice if you only play WWII simulations.

![](images/nxt-evo-ww2ce.webp)

### VKB Gladiator NXT EVO F-14 Combat Edition

Good choice if you only play *DCS: F-14 Tomcat*

![](images/gladiator-nxt-evo-f-14ce.webp)

### Virpil VPC VFX grip with WarBRD-D base

Good choice if you only play *DCS: F-14 Tomcat*

![](images/vpc-vfx.webp)

### Thrustmaster AVA base with F-16C or F/A-18C grip

Significantly more expensive than an Orion 2. Only consider this if shipping and import fees make it cheaper than a Winwing.

### RealSimulator F-16 side grip with FSSB-R3 base

For serious F-16 enthusiasts with very high budgets.

![](images/realsimulator.webp)

{{< youtube feqtkpDfuN0 >}}

### VPForce Rhino

For serious DIYers with extraordinary budgets and patience. Grip not included, requires custom assembly

{{< youtube QDU5VHS-YzQ >}}

## Not Recommended

### CH Products Fighterstick

This used to be Recommended with Reservations as a used option, but the Winwing Ursa Minor is now a significantly better option in that price range.

### Turtle Beach Velocity One Flightstick

Badly designed. Has an inverse force curve making precise inputs and aiming extremely difficult.

### Turtle Beach Velocity One Flight Deck

Not great, not terrible, but for the price you can get a much better HOTAS from VKB.

### Thrustmaster HOTAS Warthog Flight Stick

Poor gimbal quality, stick is too heavy for the base, you can get much better sticks for less money

### Winwing Orion 2 NavyAce (formerly F/A-18 Hornet)

More expensive than the ViperAce grip for fewer buttons. Even if you only play *DCS: F/A-18C Hornet*, you should get the F-16 grip since youâ€™ll want extra buttons for communications. If you play *DCS: F-15E Strike Eagle*, the ViperAce grip is recommended instead to provide an analog input for the WSOâ€™s Hand Controller Unit.

### VKB Gunfighter Modern Combat Edition Pro

The MCE Ultimate fixed a number of criticisms over the MCE Pro and is worth the cost difference.

### Moza AB9 Force Feedback

We have heard reports that Moza's force feedback software interferes with other DCS tools including SimpleRadio-Standalone. We recommend VPForce as an alternative, because of the excellent software.

# Throttles

## Recommended

### VKB STECS

Customizable, best value!

> ðŸ’¡ The Mini version is intended for use with a separate mount; The Mini Plus/Standard/Max versions can be used as desktop devices out of the box. You can make a desktop plate for the Mini from some scrap wood.

### Winwing Orion 2 StrikeAce EX II (formerly StrikeAce EX / F-15EX)
    
![](images/orion-2-f15-ex-throttle.webp)
    
## Recommended with Reservations

### Virpil VMAX Prime Throttle

Great quality, but is expensive compared to competition such as VKB STECS and Winwing Orion 2.

![](images/vpc-vmax-prime-throttle.bmp)

### Virpil VPC MongoosT-50CM3

Great quality, but is expensive compared to competition such as VKB STECS.
    
![](images/mongoost-50cm3.webp)
    
### Virpil VPC CDT-VMAX

Smaller version of the MongoosT-50M3. Great quality, but for most users the VKB STECS is the better value.
    
![](images/vpc-cdt-vmax.webp)
    
### Thrustmaster TWCS

Widely available. Has [stiction](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stiction) issues, which can be fixed by [replacing the lubricant](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sa0Qb2hq6tQ) or [replacing the slider](https://www.etsy.com/search?explicit=1&q=twcs+slider+mod&ref=s2_trn&order=highest_reviews). Commonly develops issues with the thrust and paddle axes.
    
![](images/twcs.webp)

### Winwing Ursa Minor Space Joystick

A budget clone of the VKB Gladiator Omni Throttle with more buttons and a vibration motor. Designed for space simulation, but can also be used as a serviceable flight simulation throttle. Made from a cheaper-feeling plastic compared to the Gladiator.

![](images/ursa-minor-space-joystick-l.bmp)
    
### VKB Gladiator NXT EVO Omni Throttle

A great device for space simulation, which can also be used as a serviceable flight simulation throttle.
    
![](images/gladiator-nxt-evo-omni-throttle.webp)
    
### Thrustmaster HOTAS Warthog throttle

Throttle grip and axis is good. The switches on the base are overly specific to *DCS: A-10C Warthog*. Can be found used for a decent value, but VKB STECS is almost always a better choice. Units made before late 2022 have a poor quality slew control which benefits from a [third-party replacement](https://deltasimelectronics.com/products/thumbstick-slew-sensor-adapter). All versions benefit from the [third-party firmware](https://deltasimelectronics.com/pages/install-instructions).
    
![](images/warthog-throttle.webp)
    
### Winwing Orion 2 ViperAce (formerly F-16)

If you mostly play *DCS: F-16C Viper, DCS: JF-17 Thunder* and *Falcon BMS*
    
![](images/orion-2-f-16-throttle.webp)
    
### Thrustmaster Viper TQS

If you mostly play *DCS: F-16C Viper, DCS: JF-17 Thunder* and *Falcon BMS* and you live somewhere this is cheaper than a Winwing Orion 2 F-16 throttle
    
![](images/viper-tqs.webp)
    
### Winwing Orion 2 StrikeAce E (formerly F-15E)

If you mostly play *DCS: F-15E Strike Eagle.* Notably, it has a speedbrake switch which the StrikeAce EX grip lacks.
    
![](images/orion-2-f-15e.webp)
    
### VKB GNX WWII Throttle

If you mostly fly WWII aircraft, early to mid cold war aircraft, and/or *DCS MiG-29/Su-25/Su-27/Su-33*
    
![](images/gnx-ww2-throttle.webp)
    
## Not Recommended

### CH Products Pro Throttle

Worse than a modded Thrustmaster TWCS.

# HOTAS (Stick & Throttle Bundles)

## Recommended

### Winwing Orion 2 HOTAS MAX

Bundle of the Winwing Orion 2 ViperAce EX Viper stick and Orion 2 throttle. Choice of replica F/A-18, replica F-15E and fictionalized F-15EX throttle grips available. A close match to the real controls of an A-10 or F-15E.

### Thrustmaster T16000M FCS HOTAS

Bundle of the Thrustmaster T16000M FCS stick and TWCS throttle
    
![](images/t16000m-fcs-hotas.webp)
    
### Winwing Orion 2 HOTAS ViperAce

Bundle of the Winwing Orion 2 ViperAce EX stick and Orion 2 ViperAce throttle. A close match to the real controls of an F-16.
    
![](images/orion-2-hotas-f-16.webp)

## Not Recommended

### Thrustmaster T-Flight HOTAS

Designed for game consoles. Too few buttons for simulation use

### Logitech/Saitek X52

Commonly develops axis jitter issues. Production quality seems ti be severely declining, with users who purchased units in the 2020s reporting issues in less than one year.

### Logitech/Saitek X52 Pro

Similar problems to X52

### Logitech X56/Saitek X55

Stick is not terrible but the throttle is very stiff. Worse for the price than buying a VKB Gladiator and Thrustmaster TWCS separately

### Thrustmaster HOTAS Warthog

Bundle of the Thrustmaster HOTAS Warthog flight stick and throttle. See issues with HOTAS Warthog flight stick

### Hori Flight Control System for Windows

This would be fine if it was $200, but Hori is charging $500, and itâ€™s not competitive at that price.

### Turtle Beach VelocityOne Flightdeck

Stick has an inverse force curve making precise inputs and aiming extremely difficult. This might would be fine if it was below $200, but Turtle Beach is charging $400, and itâ€™s not competitive at that price.

# Rudders

Note: Rudders are not mandatory. They are strongly recommended for most helicopters and very useful for WWII aircraft and some Cold War aircraft like the Tomcat, Phantom and Scooter. For modern aircraft, a twist stick is fine.

## Recommended

### VKB T-Rudders

Single axis, no toe brakes
    
![](images/t-rudders.webp)
    
### Virpil WarBRD/VPC ACE Torq

Single axis, no toe brakes.

### Slaw Device pedals
    
![](images/slaw-device-pedals.webp)
    
## Recommended with Reservations

### Winwing Orion Metal Flight Rudder Pedals

Included spring is slightly on the strong side. Otherwise very similar to the MFG Crosswinds, but more expensive and with less customization. May be a good choice for shipping to some regions.
    
![](images/orion-pedals.webp)
    
### CH Products Pro Pedals

Can be found for a good price used. Very narrow.
    
![](images/pro-pedals.webp)
    
### Virpil VPC ACE

Similar to the MFG Crosswind V3. Might be a good choice if youâ€™re buying other Virpil products and can bundle the shipping
    
![](images/vpc-ace-pedals.webp)
    
### Thrustmaster TPR

Expensive, some reports of reliability issues
    
![](images/tpr.webp)
    
## Not Recommended

### Logitech/Saitek Pro Flight

Very poor build quality

### Thrustmaster T.Flight

Very poor build quality
