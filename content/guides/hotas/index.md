# Note On Current Events

The US is currently experiencing highly chaotic and extreme changes in
tariff policy. The cost of tariffs is passed onto the customer (i.e. you),
either in the form of increased prices on goods, or directly as fees collected
by customs authorities on packages.

You should expect significantly increased prices on most HOTAS equipment,
since all consumer HOTAS devices are manufactured outside of the United States.

# Sticks & Gamepads

## Recommended

### Gamepad

You may already have one!

If not, an 8BitDo Ultimate series gamepad can be found for under $20, and has either [Hall effect](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hall_effect_sensor) or [tunneling magneto-resistance](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tunnel_magnetoresistance) sensors which are more accurate and durable than most mass-market flight sticks.  For slightly more, controllers from FlyDigi or Gamesir add additional buttons which can be mapped in DCS using Steam Input, or high quality microswitch buttons. We don't recommend buying mass market devices from Xbox/PlayStation at this time due to stick drift issues, though they're fine if you already have one.

([Not suitable for Falcon BMS](https://forum.falcon-bms.com/topic/23233/throttle-up-down-key-bindings-are-too-coarse?_=1683335735387&lang=en-US))

### WINCTRL Ursa Minor Fighter Joystick (Formerly Winwing)

A budget clone of the VKB Gladiator with more buttons and a vibration motor. Made from a cheaper-feeling plastic compared to the Gladiator. Has a fairly short throw.

<img src="images/ursa-minor-fighter-joystick.bmp" width="1600" height="1600" loading="lazy" alt="">

### VKB Gladiator NXT EVO Space Combat Edition Premium

Best value!

### Virpil CDT-AERO-R Flightstick

### WINCTRL Orion 2 ViperAce EX (formerly Winwing F-16EX)

### VKB Gunfighter Modern Combat Edition Ultimate

<img src="images/gunfighter-mcg.webp" loading="lazy" alt="">

## Recommended with Reservations

### Logitech Extreme 3D Pro

This used to be recommended as a first joystick to try flight simulators before buying an expensive HOTAS. However, the price of this joystick has increased while the price of a general-purpose gamepad has decreased, so it's not longer the best option in the price range.

<img src="images/extreme-3d-pro.webp" width="1920" height="1920" loading="lazy" alt="">

### Thrustmaster T16000M FCS

Widely available. Commonly develops problems with axis sensors. Button layout is difficult to use while keeping hands on the HOTAS. Overall similar to the Logitech 3D Extreme Pro, but costs more.

<img src="images/t16000m-fcs.webp" width="474" height="474" loading="lazy" alt="">

### VKB Gladiator NXT EVO Space Combat Edition Standard

The Premium is worth the extra $30 for the extra hat, trigger and analog stick. However, the Standard may fit within import *de minimis* limits in some European countries.

<img src="images/gladiator-nxt-evo-sce-standard.webp" width="1100" height="1100" loading="lazy" alt="">

### VKB Gladiator NXT EVO WWII Combat Edition

Good choice if you only play WWII simulations.

<img src="images/nxt-evo-ww2ce.webp" width="1100" height="1100" loading="lazy" alt="">

### VKB Gladiator NXT EVO F-14 Combat Edition

Good choice if you only play *DCS: F-14 Tomcat*

<img src="images/gladiator-nxt-evo-f-14ce.webp" width="1100" height="1100" loading="lazy" alt="">

### Thrustmaster AVA base with F-16C or F/A-18C grip

Significantly more expensive than an Orion 2. Only consider this if shipping and import fees make it cheaper than a WINCTRL.

### RealSimulator F-16 side grip with FSSB-R3 base

For serious F-16 enthusiasts with very high budgets.

<img src="images/realsimulator.webp" width="700" height="933" loading="lazy" alt="">

{{< youtube feqtkpDfuN0 >}}

### VPForce Rhino

For serious DIYers with extraordinary budgets and patience. Grip not included, requires custom assembly

{{< youtube QDU5VHS-YzQ >}}

## Not Recommended

### CH Products Fighterstick

This used to be Recommended with Reservations as a used option, but the WINCTRL Ursa Minor is now a significantly better option in that price range.

### Turtle Beach Velocity One Flightstick

Badly designed. Has an inverse force curve making precise inputs and aiming extremely difficult.

### Turtle Beach Velocity One Flight Deck

Multiple sources have reported reliability issues with the hats and switches falling off, which is absolutely not acceptable in this price bracket.

### Thrustmaster HOTAS Warthog Flight Stick

Poor gimbal quality, stick is too heavy for the base, you can get much better sticks for less money

### WINCTRL Orion 2 NavyAce (formerly Winwing F/A-18 Hornet)

More expensive than the ViperAce grip for fewer buttons. Even if you only play *DCS: F/A-18C Hornet*, you should get the F-16 grip since you’ll want extra buttons for communications. If you play *DCS: F-15E Strike Eagle*, the ViperAce grip is recommended instead to provide an analog input for the WSO’s Hand Controller Unit.

### VKB Gunfighter Modern Combat Edition Pro

The MCE Ultimate fixed a number of criticisms over the MCE Pro and is worth the cost difference.

### Moza AB9 Force Feedback

We have heard reports that Moza's force feedback software interferes with other DCS tools including SimpleRadio-Standalone.

[Additionally, we have heard reports thnat Moza's customers have found fradulent charges on their payment cards after buying from Moza.](https://www.reddit.com/r/moza/comments/1houmep/dont_buy_from_the_moza_website/) Therefore, we do not recommend purchasing from Moza for your financial security.

We recommend VPForce as an alternative, because of the excellent software.

# Throttles

## Recommended

### VKB STECS

Customizable, best value!

> 💡 The Mini version is intended for use with a separate mount; The Mini Plus/Standard/Max versions can be used as desktop devices out of the box. You can make a desktop plate for the Mini from some scrap wood.

<img src="images/mongoost-50cm3.webp" width="1000" height="1000" loading="lazy" alt="">

## Recommended with Reservations

### Thrustmaster TWCS

Widely available. Has [stiction](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stiction) issues, which can be fixed by [replacing the lubricant](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sa0Qb2hq6tQ) or [replacing the slider](https://www.etsy.com/search?explicit=1&q=twcs+slider+mod&ref=s2_trn&order=highest_reviews). Commonly develops issues with the thrust and paddle axes.

<img src="images/twcs.webp" width="474" height="474" loading="lazy" alt="">

### WINCTRL Ursa Minor Space Joystick

A budget clone of the VKB Gladiator Omni Throttle with more buttons and a vibration motor. Designed for space simulation, but can also be used as a serviceable flight simulation throttle. Made from a cheaper-feeling plastic compared to the Gladiator.

<img src="images/ursa-minor-space-joystick-l.bmp" width="1600" height="1600" loading="lazy" alt="">

### VKB Gladiator NXT EVO Omni Throttle

A great device for space simulation, which can also be used as a serviceable flight simulation throttle.

<img src="images/gladiator-nxt-evo-omni-throttle.webp" width="474" height="474" loading="lazy" alt="">

### CDT-VMAX Throttle

Nothing wrong this this throttle, but for most people, VKB STECS is a better value.

<img src="images/vpc-cdt-vmax.webp" width="1200" height="1200" loading="lazy" alt="">

### Thrustmaster HOTAS Warthog throttle

Throttle grip and axis is good. The switches on the base are overly specific to *DCS: A-10C Warthog*. Can be found used for a decent value, but VKB STECS is almost always a better choice. Units made before late 2022 have a poor quality slew control which benefits from a [third-party replacement](https://deltasimelectronics.com/products/thumbstick-slew-sensor-adapter). All versions benefit from the [third-party firmware](https://deltasimelectronics.com/pages/install-instructions).

<img src="images/warthog-throttle.webp" width="2560" height="2222" loading="lazy" alt="">

### Winwing Orion 2 ViperAce (formerly Winwing F-16)

If you mostly play *DCS: F-16C Viper, DCS: JF-17 Thunder* and *Falcon BMS*

<img src="images/orion-2-f-16-throttle.webp" width="1600" height="1600" loading="lazy" alt="">

### Thrustmaster Viper TQS

If you mostly play *DCS: F-16C Viper, DCS: JF-17 Thunder* and *Falcon BMS* and you live somewhere this is cheaper than a WINCTRL Orion 2 ViperAce throttle

<img src="images/viper-tqs.webp" width="1000" height="1000" loading="lazy" alt="">

### WINCTRL Orion 2 StrikeAce E (formerly Winwing F-15E)

If you mostly play *DCS: F-15E Strike Eagle.* Notably, it has a speedbrake switch which the StrikeAce EX grip lacks.

<img src="images/orion-2-f-15e.webp" width="1600" height="1600" loading="lazy" alt="">

### VKB GNX WWII Throttle

If you mostly fly WWII aircraft, early to mid cold war aircraft, and/or *DCS MiG-29/Su-25/Su-27/Su-33*

![](images/gnx-ww2-throttle.webp)

## Not Recommended

### Moza MTP Throttle.

There aren't any major faults with the hardware itself. The controls on the base are oriented towards startup functions rather than commonly used functions, so it's best paired with a separate panel for commonly used flight controls. The price is a high compared to the competition.

However, [we have heard reports thnat Moza's customers have found fradulent charges on their payment cards after buying from Moza.](https://www.reddit.com/r/moza/comments/1houmep/dont_buy_from_the_moza_website/) Therefore, we do not recommend purchasing from Moza for your financial security.

### CH Products Pro Throttle

Worse than a modded Thrustmaster TWCS.

# HOTAS (Stick & Throttle Bundles)

## Recommended

### WINCTRL Orion 2 HOTAS MAX

Bundle of the WINCTRL Orion 2 ViperAce EX Viper stick and Orion 2 throttle. Choice of replica F/A-18, replica F-15E and fictionalized F-15EX throttle grips available. A close match to the real controls of an A-10 or F-15E.

## Recommended with Reservations

### Thrustmaster T16000M FCS HOTAS

Bundle of the Thrustmaster T16000M FCS stick and TWCS throttle

![](images/t16000m-fcs-hotas.webp)

### WINCTRL Orion 2 HOTAS ViperAce

Bundle of the WINCTRL Orion 2 ViperAce EX stick and Orion 2 ViperAce throttle. A close match to the real controls of an F-16.

![](images/orion-2-hotas-f-16.webp)

## Not Recommended

### Thrustmaster T-Flight HOTAS

Designed for game consoles. Too few buttons for simulation use

### Logitech/Saitek X52

Commonly develops axis jitter issues. Production quality seems ti be severely declining, with users who purchased units in the 2020s reporting issues in less than one year.

### Logitech/Saitek X52 Pro

Similar problems to X52

### Logitech X56/Saitek X55

Stick is not terrible but the throttle is very stiff. Worse for the price than buying a VKB Gladiator and Thrustmaster TWCS separately

### Thrustmaster HOTAS Warthog

Bundle of the Thrustmaster HOTAS Warthog flight stick and throttle. See issues with HOTAS Warthog flight stick

### Hori Flight Control System for Windows

This would be fine if it was $200, but Hori is charging $500, and it’s not competitive at that price.

### Turtle Beach VelocityOne Flightdeck

Stick has an inverse force curve making precise inputs and aiming extremely difficult. This might would be fine if it was below $200, but Turtle Beach is charging $400, and it’s not competitive at that price.

# Rudders

Note: Rudders are not mandatory. They are strongly recommended for most helicopters and very useful for WWII aircraft and some Cold War aircraft like the Tomcat, Phantom and Scooter. For modern aircraft, a twist stick is fine.

## Recommended

### VKB T-Rudders

Single axis, no toe brakes

![](images/t-rudders.webp)

### MFG Crosswind V3

A great choice. Buy once, cry once.

![](images/crosswind-v3.webp)

### Virpil Pedals

Good choice if you are bundling with other Virpil products to save on shipping.

![](images/vpc-ace-pedals.webp)

### WINCTRL Orion Metal Flight Rudder Pedals

Good choice if you are bundling with other WINCTRL products to save on shipping.

![](images/orion-pedals.webp)

### Slaw Device pedals

High end built-to-order devices. Built in small batches by an obsessive engineer.

![](images/slaw-device-pedals.webp)

## Recommended with Reservations

### CH Products Pro Pedals

Can be found for a good price used. Very narrow.

![](images/pro-pedals.webp)

## Not Recommended

### Logitech/Saitek Pro Flight

Very poor build quality

### Thrustmaster T.Flight

Very poor build quality

### Thrustmaster TPR

Far too expensive - for this price, you can buy Slaw Device pedals and get a far superior product.
