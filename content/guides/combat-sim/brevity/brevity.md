#### ABORT

Terminate action prior to execution, especially terminating an attack prior to weapons release.

_Eagle 11 is preparing to execute a close air support attack when the JTAC calls out "Eagle 11, ABORT ABORT ABORT!" Eagle 11 terminates the attack and breaks off without releasing weapons._

#### ALPHA CHECK

Request for bearing and range from aircraft to a specific point.

#### ANCHOR

To orbit around a specific point.

#### ANGELS

Height of a friendly aircraft in thousands of feet above mean sea level. Never used for non-friendly aircraft.

#### ANYFACE

Substitude for friendly command and control callsign if the callsign is not known.

#### ARIZONA

Aircraft has no antiradiation missiles remaining.

#### AS FRAGGED

As planned/briefed/scheduled. Short for "As in the fragmentary order (FRAGO)"

#### AWAY

Release of quantity and type of weapons.

_Eagle 11 released two bombs and calls out "Eagle 11, 2 pigs away, bullseye 232/15."_

#### AZIMUTH

Direction to threat.

#### BANDIT

An air contact which has been positively identified as an enemy but engagement is not necessarily authorized under the rules of engagement. Often incorrectly used as a synonym of [HOSTILE](#hostile) in video games.

#### BANZAI

Decision during a Beyond Visual Range (BVR) timeline to maneuver into Within Visual Range (WVR). In other words, decision to charge into a dogfight.

#### BEAM

Describes a radar contract moving within 60-110 degress angle of trail or 70-120 degrees angle from nose. In other words, a contact facing somewhat perpendicular to you.

#### BENT

System is inoperative. In other words, synonym for "broken." Opposite of [SWEET](#sweet).

#### BINGO

Pre-briefed amount of fuel needed to recover. Typically includes fuel needed to return to base, then divert to an alternate airbase, plus some extra time for safety. However, the exact parameters may vary by mission.

#### BOGEY

An air contact whose identity is unknown. Often incorrectly used as a synonym of [BANDIT](#bandit) or [HOSTILE](#hostile) in video games.

#### BOGEY DOPE

Request for information about nearest or indicated closest group. Response typically includes bearing, range, altitude, aspect, and other fill-ins.

#### BRAA

Bearing, Range, Altitude, Aspect. Typically communicates direction and distance from a friendly aircraft to a contact.

#### BREAK

Perform an immediate maximum performance turn in the indicated direction.

_Eagle 12 saw the AAA guns start blasting at the flight lead. "1, BREAK RIGHT!" The lead immediately evaded towards the right.

#### BREAK AWAY

Instruction from a tanker to a receiving aircraft to immediately separate from the tanker. Typically called out if there is a risk of a collision.

#### BUDDY LASE

One aircraft using a designating laser to guide weapons or sensors from another aircraft.

#### BUDDY SPIKE

Radar Warning Receiver (RWR) indication that a friendly aircraft has locked on.

In combat flight simulators, many players prematurely panic when this happens and yell "BUDDY SPIKE" or "BUDDY BUDDY BUDDY"; in real life, locking onto a friend is routinely used to obtain positional and velocity information and make it easier to rejoin a formation.

#### BULLSEYE

A pre-briefed reference point, or a bearing and range from that reference point to an object.

#### BUSTER

To fly at maximum sustained speed.

_"Eagle 11, we need you to buster over to Mosul, we have troops in contact requesting support." EAGLE 11's pilot pushed the throttle up to MIL and turned for Mosul._

#### CAP

Noun: Combat Air Patrol, i.e. establishment of fighters in a location to monitor for and be preared to engage air threats.

Verb: To establish a Combat Air Patrol over a location.

#### CHECK

To turn to a new relative heading.

_"CHECK 15 LEFT" called the flight lead. The flight turned to a new heading 15 degrees to the left._

#### CLEAN

No sensor information. Does not imply there are no contacts, just that they do not appear on sensors.

#### CLEARED

Authorized.

#### CLEARED HOT

Authorized to attack (CAS type 1 or 2).

#### CLEARED TO ENGAGE

Authorized to attack (CAS type 3 or air-to-air).

#### CLOSING

Decreasing separation.

#### COLD

Facing away.

#### COMMIT

Intercepting an air contact.

#### CRANK

Manuever in the given direction while continuing to maintain sensors on target.

#### DATA

Message or information available on datalink.

#### DECLARE

Request to identify a contact as [FRIENDLY](#friendly), [BOGEY](#bogey), [HOSTILE](#hostile), [NEUTRAL](#neutral), [UNABLE](#unable), or [FURBALL](#furball).

#### DEFENDING

Aircraft is maneveruing defensively in reaction to a threat.

#### DEFENSIVE

Aircraft is under attack, defending and unable to support.

#### DELOUSE

To detect, identify and engage a contact trailing a friendly.

#### DIRT

Radar Warning Receiver (RWR) indicates a surface threat in search mode.

#### DIVERT

Proceed to alternate airbase.

#### DRAG

Contact is moving 0-60 degrees trail angle or 120-180 degrees nose angle. In other words, contact is facing kinda diagonally away from you.
