TL;DR: We no longer recommend the Meta Quest 2.

**We purchased this headset with our own money for this review.**

- The Quest 2's screen is outdated, and too blurry to see cockpit gauges.
- Meta's Quest Link software is a pain for flight simmers.
- Meta used multiple suppliers for the Quest 2 LCD panel, with significant variance in color and visibly different pixelation. You might get a panel with good color, or one with washed out colors.
