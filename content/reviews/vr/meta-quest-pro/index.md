TL;DR: We do not recommend the Meta Quest Pro for flight simmers.

**We purchased this headset with our own money for this review.**

> ⚠️  We do not recommend buying a Quest headset without a warranty. Meta has had issues with mandatory software updates bricking headsets, including out-of-warranty devices.

- The Quest Pro is lower resolution than modern headsets, including the [Quest 3](guides/vr/headsets/meta-quest-3).
- Eye tracking with OpenXR is only available in debug mode. This requires a developer account, which must be verified by Meta. *The author had to send their driver’s license to Meta to pass verification. Your experience may vary.*
- The eye tracking on the Quest Pro is not as good as other headsets when used with PC VR. It lags behind your gaze by a few frames. *The author finds this noticeable but tolerable. Your experience may vary.*
- Some users report eye & face tracking hardware failure due to sweat/moisture.
- The slightly better controllers on the Quest Pro compared to the Quest 3 are of limited use for stationary simulations.
- There are *some* advantages - good comfort, ability to see your HOTAS and keyboard through the gap between the headset and your face, and the included controllers are great for roomscale games. But the advantages aren’t worth the tradeoffs for most people, given this price point.
- Awkward middle child between the Meta Quest 3 and Pimax Crystal.
