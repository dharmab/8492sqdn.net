TL;DR We used to recommend the Pimax Crystal (and [Crystal Light](../pimax-crystal-light)) as one of our top picks for a high-end VR headset. However, we recommend waiting for reviews for the [Pimax Crystal Super](../pimax-crystal-super) and [Bigscreen Beyond 2](../bigscreen-beyond-2).

**We purchased this headset with our own money for this review.**

# Pros

- Same Pros as [Crystal Light](../pimax-crystal-light)
- Excellent eye tracking

# Cons

- Expensive
- Requires a separate battery, even when connected to power source
- Heavy and bulky
- Similar cons to Crystal Light: Inside-out tracking issues, medicore microphone and speaker quality, mixed customer support experiences
