We purchased a Bigscreen Beyond 2e and received it in October 2025.

- Shipping times for the headset and accessories are very long, in my experience usually about double the stated shipping time.
  - If you order a Bigscreen headset at time of writing (January 2026) it is likely that the Steam Frame will be out before you receive your Bigscreen.
- The headset requires Valve Lighthouses to work. Lighthouses are a discontinued product and _will_ break over time, due to mechanical breakdowns or firmware issues. There is no company making replacements, they are not user serviceable due to safety risks with the laser, and used units have spiked in price. **This is an existential risk to all Bigscreen Beyond headsets.**
- The brightness of the display is mediocre. Some titles and scenes look less impressive than they do in other headsets, e.g. a bright summer day doesn't feel immersively bright.
- The headset has severe, awful glare/bloom in dark scenes. Some scenes, such as mission briefings in Project Wingman and the SteamVR menu, are pretty much unwatchable. Others, such as dark night flights in DCS World, are annoying but playable.
- The routing of the USB-C cable is annoying while you fly. It wraps around from left to right, then curves down your back. You feel it along your back and left arm while you play. Improved 3D printable verisons are available online.
- The headstrap isn't the best I've used. I find it needs to be readjusted every time I don or doff the goggles. (For comparison, I'm an avid motorcyclist and casual cyclist, and my budget, affordable goggles for those hobbies are made of much nicer materials that need adjustment perhaps once per riding season.) There are 3D printable adapters available to use the Apple Vision Pro straps, which are much better.
- Eye tracking on the 2e is responsive, although it was a bit of a hassle to set up. (The eyetracking software is still in beta and has a very basic UI full of bewildering technical terms.)
- We hit a few setup snags, including one issue for which the fix was documented no where except the Bigscreen Discord.
- Otherwise, the experience has been positive so far. The small size of the unit is incredibly impressive. The display clarity and performance experience have so far been good. These are my favorite flight sim goggles out of everything I've tried. However **I cannot recommend it unless an alternative source of Lighthouses exists**.
