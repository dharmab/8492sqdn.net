TL;DR: We _reluctantly_ recommend the Meta Quest 3 for flight simmers who want to try VR on a budget. We strongly prefer other headsets due to the painful experience of Meta's PCVR software.

**We purchased this headset with our own money for this review.**

> ⚠️  We do not recommend buying a Quest headset without a warranty. Meta has had issues with mandatory software updates bricking headsets, including out-of-warranty devices.
